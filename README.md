# Chromat-Ynk


Implementation of the Chromat-Ynk project by Efe Tatar, Nathan Signoud, Alize Fortunel, Francois Bretagne.
The concept behind the project belongs to Cy Tech who charged the authors with its implementation.

This project is composed of two modules, the language interpreter and the interface.

## Interpreter
The Abbas language interpreter takes in a .abbas file and interprets it. It implements variables, functions, arithmetic operations
and boolean operations. Although the language is standalone, it has additionnal features when linked to an interface. Theses features
include managing cursors enabling the user to draw lines on a canvas. Because of the nature of the interpreter, the user can manage
to draw smooth shapes such circles, squares, sinusoidal curves and much more.

## Interface
The Interface enables the user to interpret .abbas files and visualise outputs. The user can choose to visualise the drawing process
either step by step or in a constant speed.
